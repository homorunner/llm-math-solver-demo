1,Find the sum of all integer bases \( b > 9 \) for which \( 17_b \) is a divisor of \( 97_b \).,70
3,"The 9 members of a baseball team went to an ice-cream parlor after their game. Each player had a single-scoop cone of chocolate, vanilla, or strawberry ice cream. At least one player chose each flavor, and the number of players who chose chocolate was greater than the number of players who chose vanilla, which was greater than the number of players who chose strawberry. Let \( N \) be the number of different assignments of flavors to players that meet these conditions. Find the remainder when \( N \) is divided by 1000.",16
4,"Find the number of ordered pairs \( (x, y) \), where both \( x \) and \( y \) are integers between -100 and 100, inclusive, such that
\[
12x^2 - xy - 6y^2 = 0.
\]",117
5,"There are \( 8! = 40320 \) eight-digit positive integers that use each of the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 exactly once. Let \( N \) be the number of these integers that are divisible by 22. Find the difference between \( N \) and 2025.",279
6,"An isosceles trapezoid has an inscribed circle tangent to each of its four sides. The radius of the circle is 3, and the area of the trapezoid is 72. Let the parallel sides of the trapezoid have lengths \( r \) and \( s \), with \( r \neq s \). Find \( r^2 + s^2 \).",504
7,"The twelve letters \( A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, \) and \( L \) are randomly grouped into six pairs of letters. The two letters in each pair are placed next to each other in alphabetical order to form six two-letter words, and then those six words are listed alphabetically. For example, a possible result is \( AB, CJ, DG, EK, FL, HI \). The probability that the last word listed contains \( G \) is \( \frac{m}{n} \), where \( m \) and \( n \) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \( m + n \).",821
8,"Let \( k \) be a real number such that the system
\[
|25 + 20i - z| = 5
\]
\[
|z - 4 - k| = |z - 3i - k|
\]
has exactly one complex solution \( z \). The sum of all possible values of \( k \) can be written as \( \frac{m}{n} \), where \( m \) and \( n \) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \( m + n \). Here \( i = \sqrt{-1} \).",77
9,"The parabola with equation \( y = x^2 - 4 \) is rotated \( 60^\circ \) counterclockwise around the origin. The unique point in the fourth quadrant where the original parabola and its image intersect has \( y \)-coordinate \( \frac{a - \sqrt{b}}{c} \), where \( a, b, \) and \( c \) are positive integers, and \( a \) and \( c \) are relatively prime. Find \( a + b + c \).",62
12,"The set of points in 3-dimensional coordinate space that lie in the plane \( x + y + z = 75 \) whose coordinates satisfy the inequalities
\[
x - yz < y - zx < z - xy
\]
forms three disjoint convex regions. Exactly one of those regions has finite area. The area of this finite region can be expressed in the form \( a\sqrt{b} \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are positive integers and \( b \) is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find \( a + b \).",510
13,"Alex divides a disk into four quadrants with two perpendicular diameters intersecting at the center of the disk. He draws 25 more line segments through the disk, drawing each segment by selecting two points at random on the perimeter of the disk in different quadrants and connecting those two points. Find the expected number of regions into which these 27 line segments divide the disk.",204
14,"Let \( ABCDE \) be a convex pentagon with \( AB = 14 \), \( BC = 7 \), \( CD = 24 \), \( DE = 13 \), \( EA = 26 \), and \( \angle B = \angle E = 60^\circ \). For each point \( X \) in the plane, define
\[
f(X) = AX + BX + CX + DX + EX.
\]
The least possible value of \( f(X) \) can be expressed as \( m + n\sqrt{p} \), where \( m \) and \( n \) are positive integers and \( p \) is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find \( m + n + p \).",60
15,"Let \( N \) denote the number of ordered triples of positive integers \( (a, b, c) \) such that \( a, b, c \leq 3^6 \) and \( a^3 + b^3 + c^3 \) is a multiple of \( 3^7 \). Find the remainder when \( N \) is divided by 1000.",735
